This month has been full of surprises, challenges, and a wealth of information from which I tried to learn as much as possible. Together with the trainers, who were very patient with us, I managed to bring the application to this form. Although I had to miss three days due to a surprise holiday planned by my parents, I tried my best to bring the project to a final form. I really appreciate the opportunity to gain experience from this internship! ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ I also want to thank my colleagues for the help they provided, and I hope that the help I tried to offer was useful."
